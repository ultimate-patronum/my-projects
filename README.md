## üíº Experience

### [Emerging Media Lab, UBC](https://wiki.ubc.ca/Documentation:23-1003_Nurse_Practitioner) ‚Äî Developer & Team Lead  
*May 2025 ‚Äì Aug 2025, Vancouver, BC*  
I worked on the **OSCE simulation MVP** project, a VR training tool for nurse practitioners built in Unreal Engine and deployed to Meta Quest 3.  
- **Prompt engineering & persona modeling**: Created realistic **MetaHuman personas** for AI-driven patient interactions. Refined prompts to reduce hallucinations and prevent jailbreaking while keeping conversations natural.  
- **Codebase modernization**: Rewrote large portions of the Unreal project for maintainability, upgrading from 5.4 ‚Üí 5.5. Cleaned up code architecture and removed technical debt.  
- **UI integration**: Connected complex VR UI flows with the AI dialogue system, ensuring state consistency across multiple interaction modes.  
- **Performance optimization**: Debugged GPU/CPU bottlenecks and achieved a **150% performance improvement** on Quest 3.  
- **User testing**: Ran structured VR tests with medical students to validate UI/UX and improve simulation reliability.
